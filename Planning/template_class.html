					<h1>Brief</h1>
				<p>I am creating a "fruit bowl" program that will describe the contents of a fruit bowl to the user.
					Ideally, the user will be able to modify the contents of the fruit bowl through a menu of options.

<h1>Sprint ONE</h1>

				<img src="assets/img/s1board.png" width="100%"%>
				<h3>Sprint one test</h3>
				<p>Screenshot to go here</p>
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>The fruit bowl program now contains a list of fruits, a function that will review that list, and a
					"main" function that will run the menu and allow the user to interact with the program.
					In the next sprint, the goal is to have a loop running, as well as a menu, so the user knows
					how to activate a function, as well as adding a "quit" option.</p>

				<h1>Sprint TWO</h1>
				<h3>Rough program plan</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s2plan.jpg" width="50%">
				<h3>Sprint two board</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s2board.png" width="100%">
				<h3>Sprint two test</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s2run.png" width="50%">
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>The program now has a menu that the user is able to interact with. The loop means that the program
				will continue running again and again unless the user deliberately stops it (which they now have the
				option to do) - this will be useful in later versions where more options will be added to the menu.</p>
				<p>In the next version, I will focus on adding more functions to the program. The next sprint I do will
				focus on add/subtract functions, where the user can change the amount of fruit in a bowl.</p>

				<h1>Sprint THREE</h1>
				<h3>Rough program plan</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s3plan.jpg" width="50%">
				<h3>Sprint three board</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s3board.png" width="100%">
				<h3>Sprint three test</h3>
				<img src="assets/img/s3run.png" width="100%">
				<h3>Reflection</h3>
				<p>I have successfully completed all the goals of this sprint. However, in my testing I have noticed
				that it is possible for a user to have a negative number of fruits in the bowl - this should not be
					allowed and will be addressed after all of the major functions have been added.</p>
